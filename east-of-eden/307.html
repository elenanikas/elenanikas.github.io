      <p> "I’m wondering whether I can explain," said Lee.<em>“Where there is no likeness of experience it’s very difficult.</em>  I understand you were not born in America." </p>

      <p> “No, in Ireland.” </p>

      <p>“And in a few years <em>you can almost disappear;</em> while I, who was born in Grass Valley, went to school and several years to the University of California, <em> no chance of mixing."</em>
      </p>

      <p>“If you cut your queue, dressed and talked like other people? </p>

      <p>“No. I tried it. To the so-called whites <em>I was still a Chinese, but an untrustworthy one; and at the same time my Chinese friends steered clear of me.</em> I had to give it up.”</p>

      <p>Lee pulled up under a tree, got out and unfastened the check rein. “Time for lunch,” he said. “I made a package. Would you like some?”</p>

      <p>“Sure I would. Let me get down in the shade there. <em>I forget to eat sometimes, and that’s strange because I’m always hungry.</em> I’m interested in what you say. It has a sweet sound of authority. Now it peeks into my mind that you should go back to China.”</p>

      <p>Lee smiled satirically at him. “In a few minutes I don’t think you’ll find a loose bar I’ve missed in a lifetime of search. I did go back to China. My father was a fairly successful man. It didn’t work. <em>They said I looked like a foreign devil; they said I spoke like a foreign devil. </em> I made mistakes in manners, and I didn’t know delicacies that had grown up since my father left. They wouldn’t have me. You can believe it or not–I’m less foreign here than I was in China.”</p>
